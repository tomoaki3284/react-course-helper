This course spans the continent of Africa, but also investigates black diaspora settlements around the world, to redefine our Western understanding of ritual  and performance . Here, we will discover that 'ritual' is not always cosmic or spiritual, but sometimes involves the intimate activity of body decoration, or hairstyling; that 'performances' are a daily, central aspect of most black communities-that distinctly theatric elements of social performance are not only a part of masquerades, but also seen in traditional wrestling matches (and body design), ritual seclusion and fattening, and religious (or funerary) processions. This course is especially invested in addressing prevalent themes of performance in the African Diaspora (especially in the African-American culture), and understanding the many connections between diaspora performance and theatre to the visual arts of Africa.",

Students will explore strategies for assessing and supporting language and communication skills, including the use of augmentative and alternative communication approaches and other assistive technologies. Students will consider language and communication teaching from a Universal Design for Learning perspective and will be exposed to culturally responsive interventions that support oral and written language proficiency and communicative competence. Issues and practices related to language and culturally appropriate assessment and intervention for speech, language, and communication difficulties will be examined in alignment with the department's commitment to Critical Engagement with Diversity and Social Justice.",

The human-environmental interaction is emphasized. Laboratory and field experiments will explore the various spheres of the Earth and include map interpretation, remote sensing analysis, atmospheric studies, geomorphology investigation, and other human-environment interactions.",
